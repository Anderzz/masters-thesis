# Exploring the state of the art in ultrasound image segmentation

This repository contains the code used in my master's thesis project on cardiac ultrasound segmentation. It comprises preprocessing and training pipelines for a basic U-Net and nnU-Net on the CAMUS and HUNT4 datasets.
Instructions for nnU-Net can be found in [nnunet/usage_instructions.md](nnunet/usage_instructions.md).
