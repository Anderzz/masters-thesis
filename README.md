In the current state, this repository contains a basic toturial 
to preprocess the CAMUS dataset and train a nnU-Net model on it.
Instructions can be found in [nnunet/usage_instructions.md](nnunet/usage_instructions.md).

In the future, it will contain a basic pipeline to train a U-Net 1 on CAMUS as well.
